create a python script that searches for lines with "CUSTOMER X" in an excel and copies them to another excel

Sure! To accomplish this task, you can use the pandas library in Python, which is excellent for handling Excel files. Here is a step-by-step guide along with the script:

Install the required libraries: Ensure you have pandas and openpyxl installed. You can install them using pip if you don't already have them:

sh
Copy code
pip install pandas openpyxl
Create the Python script:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the Excel file
input_file = 'input.xlsx'  # Replace with your input file name
output_file = 'output.xlsx'  # Replace with your output file name

# Read the Excel file
df = pd.read_excel(input_file, sheet_name=None)

# Initialize an empty DataFrame to store the results
result_df = pd.DataFrame()

# Iterate over each sheet
for sheet_name, sheet_df in df.items():
    # Filter rows where any cell contains "CUSTOMER X"
    filtered_df = sheet_df[sheet_df.apply(lambda row: row.astype(str).str.contains('CUSTOMER X').any(), axis=1)]
    result_df = pd.concat([result_df, filtered_df])

# Write the filtered rows to a new Excel file
with pd.ExcelWriter(output_file, engine='openpyxl') as writer:
    result_df.to_excel(writer, index=False)

print(f'Filtered rows have been written to {output_file}')
Explanation:
Loading Libraries:

We import the pandas library which is used to read and write Excel files.
Loading the Excel File:

input_file is the name of the input Excel file.
output_file is the name of the output Excel file where filtered rows will be saved.
Reading the Excel File:

pd.read_excel(input_file, sheet_name=None) reads all sheets in the Excel file into a dictionary of DataFrames.
Filtering Rows:

We initialize an empty DataFrame result_df to store filtered results.
We iterate over each sheet in the Excel file. For each sheet:
We filter rows that contain "CUSTOMER X" in any cell using apply with a lambda function and str.contains.
We concatenate the filtered rows into result_df.
Writing to a New Excel File:

We use pd.ExcelWriter to write result_df to the new Excel file specified by output_file.
Usage:
Replace 'input.xlsx' with the path to your actual input Excel file.
Replace 'output.xlsx' with the desired path for the output file.
Run the script in your Python environment.
This script will search for "CUSTOMER X" across all sheets in the input Excel file and save the filtered rows to a new Excel file. If you have any further questions or need adjustments, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
